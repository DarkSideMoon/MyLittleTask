Simple task manager 

Will coming soon 

######Requirements:
 * `Server Version` - glassFish Server Open Source Edition  4.0  (build 90)
 * `Maven` - write the maven version

######Technologies:
 * `JPA` - hibernate
 * `Web` - spring framework

######Overview: 
I couldn't add spring security technology thus i wrote my own web security. I know that is very bad example of code, but i tried different ways to solve it - nothing didn't help me. This simple web app is overview of the work of technologies such as wrote in [Technologies](https://github.com/DarkSideMoon/MyLittleTask#technologies), and i got useful knowledge in java web applications.
Thanks for the review of web application
